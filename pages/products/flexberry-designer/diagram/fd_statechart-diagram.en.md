It shows how the object transitions from one state to another. State diagrams are used to model the dynamic aspects of the system. This diagram is useful when modelling the life cycle of the object. 
From other diagrams state diagram differs in that it describes the process of changing the state of only one instance of a particular class - the same object, with object reactive, that is, an object whose behavior is characterized by its response to external events. 

## the Basic elements of Statecharts 

The state diagram can display the following elements of UML notation that are available in the Toolbox:
